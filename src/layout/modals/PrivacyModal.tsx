      <Section title="1. Who we are">
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
          SelectFirst Insurance Services ("we," "us," "our") operates this Quote-to-Bind portal on
          behalf of Doctors Professional Liability Risk Retention Group (DPL RRG). This privacy
          policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the personal information of
          individuals who use this portal to apply for professional liability insurance.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="2. Information we collect">
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>
          We collect the following categories of personal information during the application
          process:
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>
          <strong>Identifiers:</strong> Name, Social Security number, email address, phone number,
          mailing address, date of birth, zip code.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>
          <strong>Professional information:</strong> Medical speciality, practice address, scope of
          practice and procedures performed, and medical licence number.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>
          <strong>Underwriting information:</strong> Responses to underwriting questions, claims
          history, prior acts coverage status, retro dates — including, where applicable,
          disclosures about license actions, DEA status, and mental-health or substance-treatment
          history asked on the application form.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>
          <strong>Financial information:</strong> Payment card data is collected by our payment
          processor (Stripe) and is never stored on our servers.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
          <strong>Electronic signature data:</strong> Typed name signatures, timestamp, IP address,
          and browser information at the time of signing.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="2a. A note on sensitive fields">
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
          Your Social Security number is optional. When you provide it, it is sent over an encrypted
          connection and stored only on your policy record with the carrier — it is never written to
          this device's storage, so if you refresh before finishing your application you will be
          asked for it again. Your date of birth is handled the same way. Any free-text explanations
          you give on the application are transmitted to and retained by the carrier as part of your
          application.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="3. How we use your information">
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>
          We use personal information for the following purposes: to evaluate your application for
          professional liability insurance; to generate quotes and bind policies; to communicate
          with you about your application, policy, or account; to comply with legal, regulatory, and
          audit requirements; to detect and prevent fraud; and to improve our services.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
          We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="4. How we share your information">
        <p style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}>
          We share personal information only as necessary to process your insurance application:
          with DPL RRG (the carrier) for underwriting and policy issuance; with our policy
          administration system (IMS) for record-keeping; with Stripe for payment processing; with
          our CRM (Zoho) for customer service; and with regulatory authorities as required by law.
          We may also share information with reinsurers and auditors as necessary for the operation
          of the insurance program.
