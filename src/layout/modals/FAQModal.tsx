  {
    q: "Who is eligible for coverage?",
    a: "Coverage is designed for licensed physicians in the speciality shown on the home page. Enter your practice ZIP and coverage start date there for a live estimate based on where you practice.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can I get a certificate?",
    a: "On straightforward submissions you can bind online in a single session and your certificate of insurance is emailed to you instantly — no agent call required.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the price include?",
    a: "The estimate shown is a real, carrier-backed price that already includes all applicable fees and taxes. There are no hidden charges added at bind.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this claims-made coverage?",
    a: "Yes. The policy is claims-made professional liability coverage with defense costs outside the limits, and includes License Defense Protection.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who backs the coverage?",
    a: "Coverage is provided by Doctors Professional Liability Risk Retention Group (DPL RRG), rated A (Exceptional) by Demotech and reinsured by Lloyd's of London.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does my policy stay with me if I change jobs?",
    a: "Yes. The policy is portable — it stays with you, not your employer, so your coverage follows you as your practice changes.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the structural difference between Claims-Made and Occurrence?",
    a: "A Claims-Made policy covers incidents occurred AND reported while the policy remains actively in force. It requires “Tail” coverage if cancelled. An Occurrence policy covers incidents that occur during the policy period, regardless of when the lawsuit is eventually filed, meaning no tail coverage is ever required to protect that specific calendar window.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does an authorized Risk Retention Group benefit my clinical pricing?",
    a: "Under the federal Liability Risk Retention Act (LRRA), a Risk Retention Group (RRG) is authorized to sell liability protection nationwide under the primary supervision of its chartering state. This cuts down complex state-by-state filing fees, enabling us to go direct-to-broker and pass down 35% in premium savings to our professional policyholders.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer Retroactive Date Matching (Prior Acts) for changing insurers?",
    a: "Absolutely. If you are active under a previous Claims-Made policy and can provide proof of continuous coverage, we will align your “Retroactive Date” perfectly with your new SelectFirst policy. This preserves and protects your historical coverage window without requiring you to purchase expensive tail coverage from your previous carrier.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Tail Coverage and is it automatically provided?",
    a: "Tail coverage (Extended Reporting Endorsement) protects you for past incidents after a claims-made policy is canceled. SelectFirst offers dynamic free tail coverage endorsements upon your retirement (under specified premium duration requirements) or in the event of disability or death, giving your career maximum structural security.",
  },
