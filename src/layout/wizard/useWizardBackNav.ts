/**
 * The wizard "back" behaviour, extracted from `FlowLayout` so the mobile
 * topbar arrow and the desktop `<BackControl>` share exactly one
 * implementation of the per-step rules.
 *
 * Rules (unchanged from the original inline `goBack`):
 *  - step 7 (`/payment`): back into `/reviewDocusign` only while the order is
 *    still OPEN_ORDER; otherwise the signing window is past → dashboard.
 *  - step 4 (`/license-scope`): the submission already exists, so back
 *    returns to the dashboard rather than walking back through signup.
 *  - steps 1–3 / 5–6: decrement the step and navigate to `STEP_PATHS[next]`.
 *  - step 0: authenticated → dashboard, otherwise stay on step 0.
