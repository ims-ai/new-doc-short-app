/**
 * Re-fetch `GET /insured/order` for the active submission and write the

 * / `useQuoteSnapshot` read).
 *
 * Backed by the shared react-query cache (`queryKeys.order.detail`):
 *
 * - concurrent callers with the same sid share one in-flight request —
 *   react-query's own dedup, replacing the old hand-rolled `inflightBySid`
 *   Map;
 * - the `OrderDetails` / `CompleteOrder` pages read the same key, so a
 *   Resume that lands on one of them serves from cache;
 * - transient (5xx / network) failures get the client's bounded
 *   retry-with-backoff for free.
 *
 * Also rehydrates the effective date + applicant blanks from the order —
 * Resume and refresh land with empty memory-only stores.
 *
 * @param opts.ifMissing `true` → serve the cached order untouched when one is
 *   already cached for this sid (mount-time effects). Omit / `false` → force
 *   a fresh read (save + post-payment flows).
